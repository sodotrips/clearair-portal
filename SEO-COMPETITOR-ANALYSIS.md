### Priority 1: Critical Fixes (Immediate Impact)

#### 1.1 Fix H1 Tag
**Current:** "Breathe Better, Today"
**Recommended:** "Professional Air Duct Cleaning in Houston, TX | 4.9-Star Rated"

Why: The current H1 is brand-focused but misses the primary keyword. Every competitor uses location + service keywords in their H1.

#### 1.2 Optimize Meta Description
**Current:** Not optimized
**Recommended:**
```
Expert air duct cleaning in Houston & surrounding areas. $39/vent pricing, same-day service, 4.9-star rated. Family-owned with 100% satisfaction guarantee. Call 281-904-4674!
```
(156 characters - optimal length)

#### 1.3 Add Certification Badges
- Obtain NADCA certification (COIT's key differentiator)
- Display IICRC certification (UpFront's strength)
- Add BBB accreditation (Best Air's trust signal)
