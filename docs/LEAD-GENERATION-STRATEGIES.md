Subject: Air Quality Question - [Complex Name]

Hi [Name],

Quick question - when was the last time [Complex Name]
had the HVAC ducts cleaned?

I ask because I was in the area servicing a nearby
property and thought I'd reach out.

Dirty ducts can lead to:
- Tenant complaints about air quality/allergies
- Higher HVAC energy costs
- Faster filter replacements
- Potential liability issues

I offer bulk rates for complexes: $175/unit for 20+ units.

Worth a 10-minute walkthrough to assess your buildings?

[Your name]
ClearAir Solutions

## Database / Past Customer Marketing

### The Math
```
If you've completed 500 jobs:

Conservative estimates:
- 10% rebook annually = 50 jobs
- 10% refer a friend = 50 jobs
- 5% need related service = 25 jobs

Total: 125 jobs/year from existing database
Revenue: ~$40,000 (at $320 avg)
Cost: Nearly $0

This is your BEST lead source!
```

### Annual Reminder System
```
12 months after service, send:

SMS:
"Hi [Name]! It's been a year since ClearAir
cleaned your ducts at [Address].

EPA recommends cleaning every 3-5 years,
but annual check-ups catch problems early.

Reply BOOK for $50 off your next cleaning!
- The ClearAir Team"

Email:
Subject: Time for your annual duct check-up?

[Similar content with more detail]
[Before/after photos from their job]
[One-click booking link]
```

### Seasonal Campaigns

| Season | Timing | Message |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **Spring** | March | "Allergy season prep - clean air, breathe easy" |
| **Summer** | May | "AC working hard? Clean ducts = lower bills" |
| **Fall** | September | "Before you turn on heat, clean your ducts" |
| **Winter** | November | "Holiday guests coming? Fresh air for family" |

### Referral Program
```
Program: "Give $50, Get $50"

How it works:
- Existing customer refers friend
- Friend mentions referral at booking
- Friend gets $50 off
- Customer gets $50 credit toward next service

Tracking:
- Referral code per customer
- Track in spreadsheet/CRM
- Pay out monthly or apply to next service

## Competitive Intelligence

### What to Monitor

| What | How | Why |
|------|-----|-----|
| **Their reviews** | Google Alerts | See complaints to address in your marketing |
| **Their pricing** | Call as customer | Stay competitive |
| **Their ads** | Facebook Ad Library | See what messaging they use |
| **Their content** | Follow socials | Get content ideas |
| **Their trucks** | Keep eyes open | Know their service areas |
| **Their hiring** | Indeed/LinkedIn | Are they growing? |

### Mystery Shopping Script
```
Call competitor as potential customer:

"Hi, I'm looking to get my ducts cleaned.
Can you tell me about your pricing?"

Note:
- How fast they answered
- How they qualified you
- Their pricing structure
- What's included
- Their availability
- How they closed/followed up
```

### Review Mining
```
Read competitor's 1-3 star reviews.

Common complaints become YOUR marketing:
- "They were late" → "We arrive on time, guaranteed"
- "Hidden fees" → "Flat-rate pricing, no surprises"
- "Pushy upsells" → "No pressure, just honest service"
- "Couldn't reach them" → "24/7 text support"
```
